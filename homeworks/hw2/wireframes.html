						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
              <img src="assets/imgs/wireframe1.png">
							<p> Name of website: Netflix </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to provide movies and television to users. The design accomplishes the goal, as on this page it automatically plays a new or trending movie at the top. It has numerous categories, including "continue watching for (user's name)" and "new releases", so that it's easy for the user to find a show or movie to watch. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I found that the original design of the Netflix site was already good. I adjusted the sizing of the text to better reflect visual hierarchy principles. I found that the text for "new releases" and "continue watching for Aashna" were too small, and the play button and learn more buttons at the top were too big. So I adjusted the sizing accordingly. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
