							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the types of attention and how they influence what people pay attention to visually. I thought that the concepts discussed in the article were particularly relevant to UX Design. For example, the cocktail party effect, or the web party effect, predicts what users will pay the most attention to when interacting with digital products. Also, Hick's Law says that if you present the user with too many choices, it may cause a cognitive overload. Overall, I think the most important concepts discussed in the article were related to how attention influences how users interact with products. </p>
