					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that animations should be not too slow and not too fast, which can mean between a range of 200 and 500 ms. This range varies to about 400-450ms for tablets and 150-200ms for smaller devices. The article also explains how animations and transitions should vary based on the size of the device. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was being able to clearly visualize what I was learning. The article includes videos explaining all of the concepts they are teaching. I learned about a lot of new terminologies that I didn't know before, such as easing, asymmetric curves, and equal interaction, subordinate interaction. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals. If it does, you either need to soften it or even remove at all. That means that the animation shouldn’t slow down the user or prevent from performing the task." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
