					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned what the 4 Gestalt principles of emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance are, and how they apply to various graphic designs. I also learned how these principles, as well as the principle of proximity, can be applied to UI design. I learned that you should group similar/related items together, and arrange the information/content in a way that guides the reader. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing examples of the principles. For instance, I didn't realize that a lot of popular logos and graphic designs use reification, which is the principle that states that people can fill in gaps of a design. I also enjoyed learning about applications to UI design. </p>
