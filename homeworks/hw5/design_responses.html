                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that there are so many ways that you can use interactive elements and animation in websites/apps. There are really unique and creative ways to use this for apps/websites for different purposes. Animation makes the experience of using a product more enjoyable. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> It was interesting looking at different program designs and seeing all the interactive/animation elements they incorporated. For instance, in the Index&Sidebar example, as you scrolled down, the content jumped a little bit and when you selected an option, new information came on the left side. The last two designs shown were also really cool. For example, the second-to-last design made it seem like you were really there in the woods. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The first of my favorite designs is the Index&Sidebar Animation because I really like the color scheme and I think it's creative with a sidebar that pops up on the left. I also like how the information on the left floats up. Another one of my favorites is Dark, the second to last example. I think it's creative how it makes it seem like you are actually in the woods facing toward that man. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I would say 8 because the article chose a lot of diverse examples and it was fun looking at all of the exmaples. </p>
